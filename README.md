# Install

## Windows x64
Download the installer [here](https://github.com/CacahueteSansSel/mcLaunch/releases/download/v0.1.1/mcLaunch.Installer.win64.exe) and follow the instructions. If you have any warning about "Windows protected your PC", ignore it. If you don't want to use the installer, download `mcLaunch-windows.zip` from [the latest release](https://github.com/CacahueteSansSel/mcLaunch/releases/latest), extract it in a folder, and run mcLaunch.exe from there.

## Linux x64
Download `mcLaunch-linux.zip` from [the latest release](https://github.com/CacahueteSansSel/mcLaunch/releases/latest) and extract it in a folder. You may need to mark the `mcLaunch` and the `mcLaunch.MinecraftGuard` files as executable before running mcLaunch.

# Build

Make sure to have the [**.NET 8.0 SDK**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) installed, then clone the project.

Then, you can build and run the project :
```shell
$ cd mcLaunch
$ dotnet build
$ dotnet run
```

# About forking mcLaunch
If you fork mcLaunch and plan to create a derivative work out of it, you will need to do some changes :
+ You will need to remove every logos of mcLaunch and mentions of the mcLaunch name to replace with your own
+ You will need to replace the CurseForge API key and the Microsoft Azure App ID with your own created specifically for your derivative work
+ This derivative work will need to be open-source too, and with the same license, [according to it](LICENSE).
